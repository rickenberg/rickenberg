### Coding

I started coding on my Commodore 64 as a teenager and was since then fascinated by writing code. After almost a decade with building and troubleshooting electronic circuits as well as assembler programming I studied IT engineering and switched career into software development. In 2005 I started working with Microsoft technologies, primarily ASP.NET and in 2007 working with SharePoint. I settled down in Copenhagen, Denmark, and I am working for a local consulting company with SharePoint, Office365, Microsoft Azure and related technologies.

### Public speaking

Once in a while you can find me on a tech conference, SharePoint saturday or user group meeting. Here is a brief history:
